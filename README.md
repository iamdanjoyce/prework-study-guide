# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I create this Prework Study Guide as a way to get used to working with HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript

- My motivation is that I want to become a Frontend Web Developer full time.
- I built this project as a way to working of skills I needed for my bootcamp course.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
